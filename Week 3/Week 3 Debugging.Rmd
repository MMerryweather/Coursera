Three levels of indication

1. `Messages` generic / diagnostic
2. `warning` somethinf wrong but not fatal
3. `error` fatal problem has occured

All three are at a high level a `conditions` , condition to be triggered.

`invisible` prevents a function from returning that functions value to the console. Still returned into the workspace but just not printed.

useful functions:
* `is.na`

##Debugging Tools

Five tools:

1. `traceback`: prints out call stack
2. `debug`: flags a function, allows to step through line by line
3. `browser`: suspends the execution of a faction wherever its cALLED
4. `trace`: insert debugging code into a func in specific places. Useful for someone elses package, usually to inject `browser`
5. `recover`: modify error behaviour so you can browse the function call stack.
